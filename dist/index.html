            <h4>About Ali + Moof</h4>
            <p>When we met while working on the same-sex marriage campaign in Maine in 2012, we were deeply in love . . . Moof with Los Angeles, and Ali with Maine. Neither of us would have predicted that three years and many plane tickets later, we would be living together in a new city, planning a wedding that will now be recognized in all fifty states!  But here we are. Together, we've learned to love hiking and running, and we've taken on the task of eating all the tastiest food in PDX.  Ali appreciates Moof's excellent fashion taste and technological know-how and Moof benefits from Ali's green thumb, knack for cooking, and spider-killing skills. What more could a couple need to be happy?! Just our amazing friends and loving families. Thank you for being part of our wedding: we can't wait to celebrate our love and commitment to each other with all of you!</p>

            <h4>Travel</h4>
            <p>There are plenty of airport options near Laguna Beach. Here are the three best ones:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>LAX, the massive Los Angeles airport, is the furthest from the wedding location.  LAX is over an hour from Laguna Beach without traffic, but at rush hour it could take as long as three hours.  However, you'll get the most options for direct flights and airlines here.</li>
              <li>SNA/John Wayne is the medium-sized airport serving Orange County, and the closest to the wedding venue. It is just 25 minutes from SNA to Laguna Beach, or 50 minutes in traffic.  While SNA doesn't offer as many direct flights as LAX, you can find some great options through Alaska or Southwest.</li>
              <li>LGB, the tiny Long Beach airport, is somewhere in the middle. It is a major hub for JetBlue, but only a handful of other major airlines fly in here. Long Beach to Laguna is 45 minutes without traffic or an hour and a half in traffic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're just coming in for the wedding weekend, you might consider skipping the rental car. Laguna Beach is a very walkable town, with limited on-street parking and occasionally congested streets. All of the hotels we've listed have lots of restaurants and stores nearby - not to mention that the beach is just a few blocks away no matter where you are! You can book a shared ride from LAX to your hotel using SuperShuttle or a similar shared ride service. When we last checked, SuperShuttle's fee from LAX was $55 one-way and $9 for each additional passenger. From SNA, it was $29 one-way and $9 for each additional passenger.</p>
            <p>Once you're in Laguna there is a <a href="http://www.visitlagunabeach.com/plan/transportation/weekend-trolley/" target="_blank">free trolley</a> on the weekends that can get you around town. It runs every 20 minutes, starting Friday at 4 pm until Sunday at 8 pm. There are <a href="http://www.visitlagunabeach.com/plan/transportation/" target="_blank">other transit options</a> around Laguna Beach too. Or, if you definitely want your own car, you could always join forces with someone else you know who is coming to the wedding. Let us know if you are looking for car match-making help.</p>
